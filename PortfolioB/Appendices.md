### Extra Comments/Analysis:

The registration page was very simple and so took on average 49 seconds to complete. The only reason some of these would be slow is because there is a lot of typing to be done and people type at different speeds.

For P2, an average of 1:28 to login, book a seat and view it is very good. This is the full process that a user would go through to book a seat. This is also each users first time on the system and so when in use, this time would go down. A minute and a half for someone to book a seat is very good.

### Questions (answers of “none” or “nothing” left out):

1. What didn't work as expected?

* Boxes on the bottom of the main page are unclear
    
* Nothing says you haven't logged in
    
 2. What do you think are good features of the system?

-   I like how you can select equipment
    
-   Like how you can pick equipment
    
-   Does what it says and works as it should
    
-   Label for registration
    



3. Are all the options enough to book a seat?

-   Yes, enough functionality
    
-   Yes x3
    
-   Yes
    
-   No there should be an option to write a note to Rich
    

  

4. Is the UI design and colour scheme clear and suitable?

-   Yes x2
    
-   Love the design
    
-   Possibility of a change of font on the main page
    
-   Yes , very clear
    
-   Improvement on the seating layout can be made, it was unclear
    

  

5. Do you think the registration page / labels are clear?

-   Yes x3
    
-   Error messages unclear
    

  

6. Any buttons on the homage that are unclear?

-   No x2
    
-   The boxes for help at the bottom seem as if they are buttons so that is unclear x3
    
-   There should be some kind of feature that tells if the seat is available right away
    
-   Big Boxes are unclear whether if they are button or just labels
    

  

7. Any other required information?

-   No x5
    

  

### Problems/suggested changes:

-   On the equipment list, certain things such as resistors and capacitors are useless as there are thousands of them in the middle of the lab which you just take as required, not really equipment
    
-   The boxes on the bottom of the main page could be buttons or made clearer that its help.
    
-   Should be some sort of notification which says when you are logged on and registered
    
-   Floorplan unclear
    
-   Could grey out seats if they are in use
    
-   When booking, which week you are in is unclear.
