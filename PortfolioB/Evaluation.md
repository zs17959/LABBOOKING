## Evaluation

We decided it is best to do our evaluation as a real-life interview and walkthrough with real end-users whom we are expecting to use the product. Our test users are 9 students who are using the EE lab on the day and are selected by our client to do the testing. 

**Quantitative Analysis** 
The goal is for the end users to test our product and give feedback in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. In quantitative evaluation, we gave the users a list of tasks including Registration, Login, Booking and View My Bookings, where we timed them and counted the number of mistakes they made. On Average, the users spent 45 seconds for registration and 72 seconds for the Login, Booking and Display Booking process. For registration the page is simple and understandable as the answers suggest, the only reason this would take time is the amount of typing that needs to be done. This takes a fair amount of time for some people. For the booking process, 72 seconds is very good. This is the full process a user would go through to book a seat. This is also each users first time on the system so it would undoubtedly get better over time. We decided to test only on these two main functions since they are the core of the user workflow. We compared the results with the results we timed ourselves using the system. This is because, we as developers, are considered experts on using the system. We got for registration an average of 24 seconds, this is mostly due to typing speed. For the booking process we got an average of 22 seconds. This is quite a bit faster than the test users, however this is because we have done it many times and know what equipment we need or not. So as users have more bookings, they will get increasingly faster at this process.

**Qualitative Analysis** 
In our qualitative analysis, we decided to ask them the following questions: What didn’t work as expected? Are all the UI interface and labels clear? Are all the options for booking you need to book a slot there as expected? Is there any element that did not work as you expected? Etc. In addition, we also let the user give general feedback on anything they were thinking at the time, which could be improvements and suggestions, or compliments. 
When asking these questions, we made sure to follow rules to make them good and informative questions. For example, we made sure not to make our questions leading (not trying to convince the responder), loaded (by putting the responder in a difficult position), absolute (using any words like “ever” or “always”), vague, irrelevant and much more. This is so we could get the best responses and the most helpful feedback from our questions. We also continually asked “why?” when we got somewhat vague responses to narrow down what our test users were actually saying. 

**Conclusion** 
In general, the users think the product has all the functions and information they needed to book a seat. However, there are certain labels and elements that are still unclear. For example, many users misunderstood that the boxes on the main page are the button and did not see the navigation bar on the top. Users suggest that there should be a label for the floor plan of the lab for the seats and university email should be the username itself. 

As a result, we decided to make a few changes to the current user interface and functions. Now, there is an option to display the lab layout side by side with the seat booking. In addition, we also make the labels on the homepage the second way you can navigate to the student bookings.
