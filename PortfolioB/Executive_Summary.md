## Executive Summary

**

__**Client:**__  Our client is the Electrical and Electronic Engineering department, more specifically, the Electrical and Electronic Engineering Laboratory. Our main point of contact is Dr. Nick Simpson and the lab technician Richard Walker, whom we have to tailor the admin use of our product to.

__**Application Domain:**__  Our application domain is the the educational sector and how it is adapting with new technology to solve specific problems. Our product is mainly for student and staff to use without any unknown third party users from the outside community. 

__**Key Problem:**__  The main Electrical and Electronic Engineering Laboratory has recently undergone refurbishment resulting in approximately 90 sets of state-of-the-art test and measurement equipment, to be used by undergraduate students for their projects. However, students turn up without notice, causing a lack of spare seats and organisation in the lab. As a result, students who may need the seats more than others suffer from a lack of workspace. In addition, the lab manager, Richard Walker, also has a problem with organising equipment for each student since there is nothing to notify him what each student needs, resulting in a tiring and confusing situation for him every day to prepare the equipment sets for each individual student.

__**Product Solution:**__  In order to help the students book their seats and equipment efficiently, our solution is a booking and attendance system, which will be a website, for the seats in the EE laboratory. There will be the main page that will show a few buttons, once you are logged in. These buttons will be **edit user, student booking, my booking, attendance, logout**. Then on student booking the student will get to a page that will include a **plan overview of the seats in the lab**, where a user can clearly see the location of each seat. They can select a **time period and date**. The seats then will either be **available**, and so the student can book that seat, or **unavailable** and the student will have to either select a different seat, or different date and time. Once they select a seat, date and time, they can scroll down and can select which **equipment** they will require when they use the laboratory. There will be a provided list of equipment and a **text box** which the entered data gets sent the lab technician, Richard Walker, to view special requests or equipment which is not on the list. Some equipment may be unavailable. The user will then confirm the seat booking. The system is a **first come first serve system**, so if two users are trying to book the same seat, whoever books first will get the seat.

The normal user, which will be a student, can view the **entire weekâ€™s** laboratory seats starting Monday at 9 am, and they can book up to 3 consecutive hours. The student will then **scan** into the lab using their **UCARD**, which will then record their attendance, and then they scan their UCARD to sign out. They will scan their UCARD on an **RFID scanner** in the lab itself. If they book seats and do not attend 3 times then they will be **blacklisted**. The way to get off the blacklist is to talk to the admin, they will decide if the student can be removed or not. A student can register for the website via a **tablet and RFID scanner in the lab** or they can register **at home on the website** and associate their UCARD with their account in the lab when they have access to the RFID scanner. They would enter their details onto the tablet, then once they have finished they will scan their UCARD as the final piece of data. This will record their unique UCARD ID and associate this with their account to **track attendance**.

The **admin** will have a slightly **different web page** with more access than the basic user. They can also **block book seats**, not just one, and can remove students bookings. The admin can also view the blacklist and the equipment list.

__**Team Vision:**__  We think this will solve the problems the EE faculty members and students are facing in the laboratory by allowing the students to see when the seat is available and make sure they can get a seat. In addition, it will provide information to all related users before the time period, making room for necessary preparations possible. If the users know beforehand where they will be and what they will do, it will ease the unorganised system in the current lab.

__**Agile vs Waterfall:**__ Since our project has been a constant development process and we have had frequent check-ins and demonstrations with our clients Agile was the obvious choice for us. It allowed us to dynamically change what we were doing to our clients needs throughout the development process whereas if we used the Waterfall approach it would be harder, if not impossible for this to happen.
